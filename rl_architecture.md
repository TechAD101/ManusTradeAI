# Yantra X RL Architecture

This document details the Reinforcement Learning (RL) architecture of the Yantra X AI Firm.

## High-Level Architecture:

1.  **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**: Raw market data (prices, volume, news) is ingested and transformed into a feature-rich state representation.
2.  **Environment**: A simulated market environment that provides states, executes trades, and calculates rewards.
3.  **Agent**: The RL agent (e.g., DQN, PPO) that learns the optimal trading policy.
4.  **Policy Network**: A deep neural network that approximates the optimal policy (Ï€).
5.  **Value Network**: A deep neural network that approximates the value function (V) or Q-value function (Q).
6.  **Training Loop**: The iterative process of the agent interacting with the environment, collecting experience, and updating its policy and value networks.
7.  **Backtesting & Evaluation**: Rigorous testing of the trained agent on historical data to assess its performance.

## Key Components:

*   **`MarketSimulator`**: A custom OpenAI Gym-like environment that simulates market dynamics, including transaction costs and slippage.
*   **`DataLoader`**: Loads and preprocesses historical market data.
*   **`DQNAgent`**: A Deep Q-Network agent that learns to make trading decisions.
*   **`train_agent`**: The main script for training the RL agent.

## Future Enhancements:

*   **Multi-Agent RL (MARL)**: Employing multiple agents with different strategies to improve robustness and diversification.
*   **Hierarchical RL (HRL)**: Using a hierarchy of agents to make decisions at different levels of abstraction (e.g., strategic allocation vs. tactical execution).
*   **Inverse RL (IRL)**: Learning the reward function from expert demonstrations.
*   **Meta-Learning**: Learning to learn, enabling the agent to quickly adapt to new market conditions.
